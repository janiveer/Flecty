= Dictionaries

The morphosyntactic dictionaries generated by Flecty are available in
the *out* subfolder within the folder for each language. The
dictionaries are XML files which comply with the
http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/DI.html[dictionaries
module] of the http://www.tei-c.org[Text Encoding Initiative]. More will
become available as the project continues.

== Description

Each dictionary contains _only_ inflectional morphology. I’m not
interested (for the purposes of this project… yet) in semantics,
etymology, or cross-references to other words. See
https://github.com/componavt/wikokit[Wikokit] for another project which
mines Wiktionary to create machine-readable dictionaries which may
include this kind of information.

== Downloading

Clone the project, or click on *Download Zip* and unzip it to a
directory of your choice.

== Licence

The morphosyntactic dictionaries are released under the
http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/[Creative Commons
Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported] licence.

I’ve endeavoured to comply fully with Wiktionary’s terms of use in
creating these dictionaries.

== Acknowledgements

Thanks to the contributors and editors of Wiktionary for the linguistic
data. Each entry within each dictionary contains a link back to the
Wiktionary page from which the linguistic data was mined. Please see
those linked Wiktionary pages for details of the authors who wrote and
edited the original data.
