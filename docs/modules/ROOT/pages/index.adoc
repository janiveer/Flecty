= Flecty

Flecty is a project to mine https://www.wiktionary.org/[Wiktionary] to
create machine-readable morphosyntactic dictionaries.

The dictionaries are intended for use in computational linguistics,
e.g.Â natural language processing, machine assisted translation, natural
language production, etc.
